            A brief history of <a name="IE">IE</a>

                The first <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer> Internet Explorer </a> was derived
                    from Spyglass Mosaic. The original Mosaic came from NCSA, but since NCSA was a public entity it
                    relied on Spyglass as its commercial licensing partner. Spyglass in turn delivered two versions of
                    the Mosaic browser to Microsoft, one wholly based on the NCSA source code, and another engineered
                    from scratch but conceptually modeled on the NCSA browser. Internet Explorer was initially built
                    using the Spyglass, not the NCSA source code. The license to Microsoft provided Spyglass (and thus
                    NCSA) with a quarterly fee plus a percentage of Microsoft's revenues for the software. In March 2009
                    Version 8.0 was released, with the first public beta having been released on March 5, 2008. IE8
                    offered better support for web standards than previous versions, with plans for improved support for
                    RSS, CSS, and Ajax, as well as full compliance for Cascading Style Sheets 2.1. It was also the first
                    version to successfully pass the Acid2 test. In addition, Internet Explorer 8 included new features
                    such as WebSlices and an improved phishing filter. </p> </div> </body> </html>
