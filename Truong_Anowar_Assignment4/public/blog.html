									Just ahead of opening our new University of Hawaii at Manoa location comes our brand new website that we are excited to soft launch today on 12/05/19. We are proud to feature our new menu and are actively promoting our private events on the site. Special thanks goes out to Daniel Port and Rick Kazman for helping as much as they can with our coffee E-commerce store. Below are some more info about our coffee shop.

									Is your daily dose of coffee just not enough for you? Are you looking for something a little extra? Perhaps some coffee education? Or the latest gossip in the coffee industry? Then a coffee from Good Morning Coffee Shop just might be for you.
If you’re a coffee lover, coffee geek, coffee nerd, or just someone looking for more information about coffee, you can come to Good Morning Coffee Shop and we'll inform you. We'll brew a fresh batch and you can start reading, socializing or relaxing.

									Coffee is great and we think you are too. We're promoting our store by gifting our customers on Christmas Day, 1 free coffee of their choice from the menu as long as they follow, like and post about their free coffee and their experience at Good Morning Coffee Shop on our social media platforms.
